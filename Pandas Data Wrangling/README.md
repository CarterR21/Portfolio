# Pandas Exercise

## Introduction
This project is a dive into python that focuses on using the pandas library, first walking through the steps of the functions we'll need then combining them use during data cleaning and visualization. You'll be able to easily follow along and learn an introduction into the pandas library, but that does not mean your learning should stop here! Always make sure to improve and refine your skills, lets begin!

### Filtering and Indexes
Lets begin with Filtering and Indexes, a very simple start. Filtering is a wway to search a dataset for various conditions. For us we'll use it to learn more about the world populaion based by country.  The main ways to filter is by column names and data values, it's a good starting point as it works well with simple questions.

### Group By and Aggregate
Next we'll learn about Group By and Aggregate. Group By is a great too for selecting rows with similar columns. In our example we have a dataset that rates multiple icecream lavors, but if we only cared about the chocolate or vanilla ratings this would be a great way to get those results. We can then pair these groupings with aggregation functions like sum() or min() to get a return that combines the rows together as we see fit. Don't forget, there are many more aggregation functions as well, take some time to explore them!

### Merging
Merging is the most complex of the technical topics we'll cover here. There are mutiple ways to merge, such as inner, outer, right, and left, which we'll get into more during the practice. Also of not are multiple functions such as .merge, .join, and .concat. .merge and .join are the most similar but because join combines tables on indexes by default, .merge will be the most often use case for the sake of simplicity. .join is not bad, but tends to be more work to get the results you want than .merge. Another way is through .concat, .concat will add one DataFrame onto another much like .append works for strings.

### Visualization
Now that we know how to answer questions we have, lets make sure to make those answers more readable for humans! We'll include the numpy and matplotlib.pyplot as well, we wont cover them in detail as we'll only use them for the visuals. Visualization is very important, however, as it gives us the ability to show data to people in a simple and clean way to answer questions or prove points.

### Data Cleaning
After finishing the basics of the pandas library lets use them all together to first clean the data before we move onto Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Here we'll walk through the process of cleaning datasets using DataFrames. We'll be using a customer call list that we want to give to other employees that will call those customers, our objective is to make the call list as clean and straight forward as possible for ease of use.

### EDA
As a final use case lets dive into EDA and see what we can learn for the world populaion dataset. Because this is practice we'll dive in and first just explore the data, see if there is anything that jumps out at us that we want to look into deeper. It's good practice to know exactly what you want from a dataset but it's also good practice to know how to explore a data set to read it and gain insights from the data as well. It's great to always look out for suprises in the dataset or interesting results as we'll do here.
