# Crypto Currency Results

### The Questions

There are three questions I'm going to answer with this project, focused on gaining insight on how the crypto market is looking and if now would be a good time invest.

1. Has crypto currency been going up or down lately?
2. What crytpo currency is the most stable?
3. What crypto currency would be best to invest in right now?

### The Data
The data comes from [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) but it was collected by pulling the data in real time, only 20 types of crypto currency where collected. The time of the data pull comes from an unsteady market and represents as such.

### Data Wrangling
Data wrangling and cleaning was conducted doing:
- Standardizing data
- Sorting data into a prefered format
- Removing unnecessary data

### Visualization
Only one graph was needed to answer these questions. The graph shows the percentage change in value over the course of 60 days.

### Results

1. On average, these crypto currencies are trending downwards with only two increasing in value and one staying the same. Over the last 60 days, most currencies have declined a large amount with no signs of slowing down so it would be an improper time to invest in crypto at this time.
2. The most stable crypto currency is USDC as it has the least variation over this period of time. However, this is not a good investment because its value has not changed so you are not likely to gain money even if you aren't likely to lose money either.
3. Of the crypto currencies, I would not suggest not investing in any crypto currencies as there is a steady decline in value for them and it's best to buy during the dip to get the most money, none of these currencies are currently in the dip, rather they are dipping so you are likely to lose money until they stop losing money at such a pace. Once they stablize it's smart to invest right before they rise again.
