# AirBnBs in Seattle Washington 2016

## The Data
AirBnB has been growing more and more in popularity, a big jump started in 2016 so lets take a look at the dataset to see what we can learn about AirBnBs in Seattle, Washington during that time. The dataset is already clean and holds 1048281 rows of data, containing: listing_id, date, availablility, and price. It can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset)

## Results
The highest costing AirBnB is in zipcode 98134 with an average price of $206.60 dollars per night, while the lowest cost in the 98125 zipcode with an average cost of $71.00 dollars per night. These are the average highs and lows of the data so you can expect for a majority of AirBnBs to be between this cost in the entire area of Seattle, washington.

Another way that cost is affected is by the number of bedrooms a place has, there is a steady increase of cost for each additional bedroom with a spike at five bedrooms. The only time that it is cheaper to get two separte AirBnBs over getting one with more rooms is when there are six and five bedrooms on average. Renting a place with four bedrooms is the most cost effective way to rent on average.

We can also see that there is a steady decline in availability as the number of bedrooms increases, from one bedroom having 1,811 places to 6 bedrooms only having 5. It is way more likely to find places that only have one bedroom than any other number combined.

Finally we can see the revenue for the year to see when it's most common to rent and to see how steady of income one can expect. For this dataset we see a large climb from January to March and then a steady increase with minor deviation after. This means that the income from AirBnB is rather steady year round and only increasing, it would be a good time to invest in AirBnB here as over two million was made in Seattle, Washington in 2016.
